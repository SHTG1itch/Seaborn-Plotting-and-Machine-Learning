    "As the test size increases, the accuracy seems to increase, and as the shuffling applied to the data increases the accuracy also seems to increase. This is because of bias and variance, with the model becoming more accurate by being given more random values(it can't make absurd connections between data points) and it becomes more accurate given a larger testing set(another way that it can't make absurb connections, and also provides more of an evening out of mistakes due to statistics). However, if you were to increase both test size and randomness, the accuracy starts decreasing a little, this is because the benefits of both can interfere with each other leading to more mistakes. Also, the reason that I think there is a high mean squared error for the first test set is because the test sets that follow could use the same data that is present in earlier training sets leading to the model having the answers, I verified this by commenting out the original testing set and replacing it with one of the other ones, and saw that the mean squared error was super high."
